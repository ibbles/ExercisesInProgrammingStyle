# ExercisesInProgrammingStyle

Exercises from the book by Cristina Videira Lopes, but in C++.

Cristina's GitHub repository for the book can be found at https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style, which is from where I have taken the list of stop words and the example text, pride-and-prejudice.txt
